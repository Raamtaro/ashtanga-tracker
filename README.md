# Ashtanga Yoga Training Tracker

## Purpose
Provide students a method to track their daily Ashtanga practice.

- Make notes of how poses feel during practice
- Score poses on various factors such as ease of access, comfort level, etc. A "final" score will be computed based on the average rating of the different factors
- Entire practice for the day is scored based the average score of the different poses practiced that day

**Issue**

A traditional Ashtanga practice will at least include:

1. 5 x Surya A, 3 x Surya B
2. Standing Sequence
3. Half or Full Primary/Intermediate/Advanced A/B/C/D specific poses
4. Backbending Sequence (Starting with the 3 backbends, then optionally dropbacks, tick-tocks, etc.)
5. Finishing Sequence

There is room for variation within this. 

Example: A student may do full primary one day. However the next day they may do half primary followed by only a portion of the intermediate. The day they may do full intermediate without any primary. Or maybe full intermediate + a portion of the advanced series...

And so on and so forth. In all of this, for simplicity's sake, let's say they are always sandwiching the series specific practice in between the Sun salutations, Standing sequence and Finishing Sequence (as they should be).
